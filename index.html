            <p>"Dexter" is a television series that originally aired on Showtime from 2006 to 2013, with a revival titled "Dexter: New Blood" in 2021. The show is based on the novel "Darkly Dreaming Dexter" by Jeff Lindsay.

                The series follows Dexter Morgan, a forensic blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department by day and a vigilante serial killer by night. Dexter has a unique moral code that his adoptive father, Harry Morgan, instilled in him as a child. Harry recognized Dexter's homicidal tendencies and taught him to channel his urges by only targeting criminals who have escaped justice.</p>
